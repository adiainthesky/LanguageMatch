    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <h6>So you’ve decided you want to be a coder—Congratulations! The next step is figuring out which language you want to use. Most computer programmers know multiple languages, but they still had to start the learning process somewhere.  Below is a series of questions to help guide you through choosing which language might be the best for you to start with.

      <p>Based on your answers, it looks like <span id="language"></span> will be the best language for you to learn.</p>

      <br>
      <p><strong>Python</strong> is a great choice for programmers as it is used in both web and software development and data science, has simple syntax, and is relatively easy to learn.  This object-oriented language is generally used in back-end scripting and can facilitate creation of both desktop and web apps. Python is currently one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages.</p>

    <div id="Ruby">
      <img src="img/Ruby.jpg">
      <br>
      <p>Programmers love <strong>Ruby</strong> because of its simplicity and ease-of-use.  This object-oriented, server-side programming language is open-sourced and has an incredibly active community of users. While it runs a bit slower than languages like Javascript, it balances that by being easier to learn. Whereas many other languages are set up to have just one right method, Ruby follows the mantra of their being “more than one way of solving a problem.”</p>

    <div id="Javascript">
      <img src="img/JavaScript.jpg">
      <br>
      <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is an ideal choice for anyone interested in web development. And because Javascript is already running in your computer browser, there are minimal barriers to start learning! This incredibly fast front-end programming language is used on most websites. While it is a bit harder to learn than some of the easiest to learn programs, the learning time is worth it due to the high demand for this skill.</p>
